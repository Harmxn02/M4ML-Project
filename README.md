# Mathematics for Machine Learning ‚Äì Project (IB3702)

This repository contains the coursework and project materials for the **IB3702: Mathematics for Machine Learning** module.
The project explores the mathematical foundations underlying key techniques in **machine learning**, focusing on both **Calculus** and **Linear Algebra** concepts.

---

## üìò Overview

The aim of this project is to apply and deepen understanding of the mathematical tools used in modern machine learning.
Students select one topic from *Calculus* and one from *Linear Algebra* to explore both the theoretical framework and its practical implementation.

This exploration bridges mathematical theory and computational applications using examples, simulations, and small-scale experiments (e.g. Python notebooks, visualisations, or numerical demonstrations).

---

## üßÆ Project Structure

The project is divided into two modules:

### **1. Calculus in Machine Learning**

Explore how calculus underpins model training, optimisation, and approximation in ML.

Available topics:

* **Derivatives in Neural Networks (NN)** ‚Äì Understanding gradient descent, weight updates, and backpropagation.
* **Taylor Series Expansion and Approximation in ML Models** ‚Äì Using series approximations for nonlinear function modelling.
* **Hessian Matrix and Second-Order Optimisation** ‚Äì Leveraging curvature information for faster and more accurate convergence.

---

### **2. Linear Algebra in Machine Learning**

Focus on the matrix- and vector-based structures essential to ML algorithms.

Available topics:

* **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in PCA** ‚Äì Mathematical foundation for dimensionality reduction and data compression.
* **Matrix Factorisation in Machine Learning** ‚Äì Decomposition methods such as SVD and NMF for latent feature extraction.
* **Kernel Methods and the Kernel Trick** ‚Äì Techniques for non-linear transformations and their application in SVMs and other models.

---
