# Mathematics for Machine Learning â€“ Project (IB3702)

This repository contains the coursework for the **IB3702: Mathematics for Machine Learning** module.  
Our project explores two key mathematical foundations in machine learning:

1. **Derivatives in Neural Networks (Calculus)** â€“ Understanding how derivatives are used for optimisation and learning through gradient descent and backpropagation.  
2. **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors in Principal Component Analysis (Linear Algebra)** â€“ Examining how eigen-decomposition enables dimensionality reduction and feature extraction.
